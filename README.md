# Saas-Dashboard

This project is a modern, responsive dashboard built using React.js and Tailwind/MUI (or your chosen UI library). It showcases core e-commerce insights â€” revenue and sales trends, customer-facing top-seller highlights, and a robust order management table with selection, filtering, sorting, and pagination. The UI emphasizes accessibility and UX with smooth micro-interactions, theme support (light/dark), and toast notifications for user feedback. Charts are implemented using Recharts for interactive data visualization.
